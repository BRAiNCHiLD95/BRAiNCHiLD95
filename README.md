### Hi folks, my name is Brian Sam Thomas! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently a Senior Software Engineer at Pet24-7 Global Limited - working across multiple verticals building services and platforms to bring affordable and accessible veterinary care to everyone around the globe. Some of these include -

For the core (Vidtu):
- A React SPA with a Laravel backend - the main bespoke application.
- A Node.js + Express based Mediasoup SFU & Media Engine Server that uses GStreamer (as a native addon that I built in-house) - for real-time transcriptions and high fidelity recordings.
- An OpenAI integration (in Node.js) to generate AI summaries based on the meeting transcripts.
- A Node.js based CLI tool that uses FFmpeg to composite/post-process recordings generated by the Media Engine server (runs as a separate tool on AWS Batch instances).

for the other verticals (Pet/Equivet/Vet 24-7):
- A Next.js based application for 3 verticals (with common business logic, but extended for differing use-cases).
- An AI Assistant within the platform to assist with bookings, follow-ups, as well as general queries.
- An RAG bot - deeply integrated with all verticals, as well as it's own app - for 24-7 support/access.
